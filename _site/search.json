    "section": "",
    "text": "Purpose: Molar incisor hypomineralisation (MIH) is a qualitative defect of enamel characterised by demarcated opacities. Aesthetic and functional sequelae of MIH may manifest as reduced oral health related quality of life (OHRQoL). This study aims to investigate the impact of the presence and severity of MIH on children’s OHRQoL.\nMethods: This cross-sectional study recruited children aged 7 to 16 years-of-age attending specialist paediatric dental clinics in Melbourne, Australia. Clinical examination utilised the modified European Academy of Paediatric Dentistry index to quantify the presence and severity of MIH. OHRQoL data was collected via the Child Perception Questionnaire, Parent-Caregiver Perception Questionnaire and Family Impact Statement. Causal analysis used quantile regression and included poor medical health as a confounding variable. Sensitivity analysis used the same model and different strata of MIH lesion location and severity.\nResults: 131 participants with complete self-reported OHRQoL data were included in the causal analysis. The estimated average causal effect after adjusting for poor medical health showed the estimated difference in medians of child-reported OHRQoL was 6 (CI = 2.62, 12.25, p = 0.02) in the MIH group compared to the unaffected group. The estimated difference in medians of self-reported OHRQoL after adjusting for poor medical health was 7 (CI = 1.87, 11.99, p = 0.01) for severe MIH group and -1 (CI = -5.16, 3.62, p = 0.63) for the mild group compared to those unaffected. The estimated difference in medians of self-reported OHRQoL after adjusting for poor medical health was 5.16 (CI = -2.42, 10.99, p = 0.15) for participants with MIH-affected incisors compared to the rest of the cohort.\nConclusions: MIH impacts children’s OHRQoL as reported by self and parent/caregiver."

    "title": "Optimal sampling for design-based estimators of regression models in two-phase designs",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The two-phase design collects additional information on a subsample which is selected from the study cohort. It is a cost-effective sampling method when the covariates of interest are expensive to measure for every individual in the cohort. With considerate choices of stratification and phase-two sampling strategies, a two-phase design will be more efficient than simple random sampling. At the design stage, it is desirable to conduct the sampling with the optimal design which will end up with the most efficient estimations. We develop the optimal design for analysis via the IPW estimator. In order to approximate the optimal design, we propose to use a multiwave sampling framework and incorporate the whole cohort information. We show the design efficiency can be further improved using the multiwave sampling with informative priors. Generalized raking is a more efficient class of design-based estimators. We derive the optimal design for analysis via generalized raking estimators. We then compare it with the optimal design for analysis via the IPW estimator and other two-phase designs in measurement-error settings. We show the optimal design for analysis via the IPW estimator is not optimal for the generalized raking estimation but typically gives nearoptimal efficiency. It has previously been shown that semiparametric efficiency under two-phase sampling is not robust to contiguous model misspecification, if the target of inference is defined by a hypothetical analysis of complete data. In two-phase studies, the optimal design for the efficient estimator is often very different from that for design-based estimators. We show this design optimality can also be sensitive to contiguous model misspecification."

The goal of two-phase designs is to choose a subsample of individuals from the cohort and analyse that subsample efficiently. It is of interest to obtain an optimal design that gives the most efficient estimates of regression parameters. In this article, we propose a multiwave sampling design to approximate the optimal design for design-based estimators. Influence functions are used to compute the optimal sampling allocations. We propose to use informative priors on regression parameters to derive the wave-1 sampling probabilities because any prespecified sampling probabilities may be far from optimal and decrease the design efficiency. The posterior distributions of the regression parameters derived from the current wave will then be used as priors for the next wave. Generalized raking is used in the final statistical analysis. We show that a two-wave sampling with reasonable informative priors will end up with a highly efficient estimation for the parameter of interest and be close to the underlying optimal design."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Molar incisor hypomineralisation (MIH) is a qualitative developmental enamel defect with a prevalence of 13% worldwide. This review aims to outline the current evidence regarding the impact of MIH on children’s oral health and, more broadly, their day-to-day activities. MIH is associated with negative sequelae, including hypersensitivity, post-eruptive breakdown, the rapid development of carious lesions and poor aesthetics. Other concerns pertain to the clinical management of MIH and include difficulty in achieving local anaesthesia, increased dental fear and anxiety (DFA) and increased behaviour management problems. Oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) is the most standardised measure of patient impact; however, no instruments have been validated for use in MIH populations. The few existing observational studies investigating the impact of MIH on OHRQoL in children have produced conflicting results. Interventions to alleviate hypersensitivity and improve aesthetics had a positive impact on the OHRQoL of MIH-affected children. Multiple methodological issues make it difficult to measure the impact of MIH, including heterogeneity in the MIH severity classification, an overlap in the indices used to diagnose dental caries and MIH as well as the subjectivity of outcome measures for hypersensitivity and DFA."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nIn regression models fitted to data from complex survey designs, sampling weights often incorporate non-essential variation, inflating variance estimates. Stabilised weights mitigate this issue by adjusting sampling weights to account for variation explained by covariates. We evaluate the performance of optimal stabilised weights and propose combining the stabilised weights estimator with generalised raking, a class of efficient design-based estimators. This combination improves efficiency by reducing unnecessary weight variation and leveraging information from auxiliary variables. We show this combination can be implemented using the standard statistical package that handles two-phase samples and generalised raking. Simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed estimator enhances precision under realistic two-phase designs, though efficiency gains may be limited in highly informative designs.\nlink: https://mscs.uic.edu/events/statistics-and-data-science-seminar-generalised-raking-and-stabilised-weights-for-regression-modelling-in-two-phase-samples-by-tong-chen/"

We examined the performance of these methods in simulation studies and applied them to investigate the longitudinal relationship between body mass index (BMI) and blood pressure (BP) in the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children, with potential mediation by the NMR metabolomic profile (228 metabolites).

    "text": "The 2018 Joint NZSA/ORSNZ Conference\n\nAbstract\nQuadratic forms of Gaussian variables occur in a wide range of applications in statistics. They can be expressed as a linear combination of chi-squareds. The coefficients in the linear combination are the eigenvalues \\lambda_{1},...,\\lambda_n of \\Sigma A, where A is the matrix representing the quadratic form and \\Sigma is the covariance matrix of the Gaussians. The previous literature mostly deals with approximations for small quadratic forms (n&lt;10) and moderate p-values (p&gt;10^{-2}). Motivated by genetic applications, moderate to large quadratic forms (300&lt;n&lt;12,000) and small to very small p-values (p&lt;10^{-4}) are studied. Existing methods are compared under these settings and a leading-eigenvalue approximation, which only takes the largest k eigenvalues, is shown to have the computational advantage without any important loss in accuracy. For time complexity, a leading-eigenvalue approximation reduces the computational complexity from O(n^3) to O(n^2k) on extracting eigenvalues and avoids speed problems with computing the sum of n terms. For accuracy, the existing methods have some limits on calculating small p-values under large quadratic forms. Moment methods are inaccurate for very small p-values, and Farebrother’s method is not usable if the minimum eigenvalue is much smaller than others. Davies’s method is usable for p-values down to machine epsilon. The saddlepoint approximation is proved to have bounded relative error for any A and \\Sigma in the extreme right tail, so it is usable for arbitrarily small p-values."

The goal is to choose a subsample of people from the sampled sub-cohort and analyse that subsample efficiently. There is a large body of literature on statistical inference for two-phase designs. However, compared with estimation methods, there is much less attention focused on the design aspect. It is desirable to obtain an optimal design which ends up with the most efficient estimation. In this talk, I will firstly introduce two-phase sampling and corresponding estimation methods. Thereafter, I will present a multi-wave sampling strategy and what we currently know about optimal design. I will focus on design-based estimation without making strong assumptions about the model."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Poster presented at Australasian Applied Statistics Conference 2022\n\nAbstract\nA common problem in health research is that we have a large database with many variables measured on a large number of individuals. We are interested in measuring additional variables on a subsample; these measurements may be newly available, or expensive, or simply not considered when the data were first collected. The intended use for the new measurements is to fit a regression model generalisable to the whole cohort (and to its source population). This is a two-phase sampling problem; it differs from some other two-phase sampling problems in the richness of the phase I data and in the goal of regression modelling. In particular, an important special case is measurement-error models, where a variable strongly correlated with the phase II measurements is available at phase I. We will explain how influence functions have been useful as a unifying concept for extending classical results to this setting, and describe the steps from designing for a simple weighted estimator at known parameter values through adaptive multiwave designs and the use of prior information. We will conclude with some comments on the information gap between design-based and model-based estimators in this setting.\nThe poster can be found here"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Background: Digital methods that enable early caries identification can potentially streamline data collection in research and optimize dental examinations for young children. Intraoral Scanners are devices used for creating 3D models of teeth in dentistry and are being rapidly adopted into clinical workflows. Integrating fluorescence technology into scanner hardware can support early caries detection. However, the performance of caries detection methods using 3D models featuring color and fluorescence in primary teeth is unknown.\nObjective: This study aims to assess the diagnostic agreement between visual examination, on-screen assessment of 3D models in approximate natural colors with and without fluorescence and application of an automated caries scoring system for caries detection in primary teeth.\nMethods: The study sample will be drawn from eligible participants in a randomized controlled trial at the Royal Children’s Hospital, Melbourne, where a dental assessment was conducted, including visual examination using the International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS) and intraoral scan using the TRIOS 4 (3Shape TRIOS A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark). Participant clinical records will be collected, and all records meeting eligibility criteria will be subject to an on-screen assessment of 3D models by four dental practitioners. First, all primary tooth surfaces will be examined for caries based on 3D geometry and color, using a merged ICDAS index. Second, the on-screen assessment of 3D models will include fluorescence, where caries will be classified using a merged ICDAS index that has been modified to incorporate fluorescence criteria. After four weeks all examiners will repeat the on-screen assessment for all 3D models. Finally, an automated caries scoring system will be used to classify caries on primary occlusal surfaces. The agreement in the total number of caries detected per person between methods will be assessed using a Bland-Altman analysis and intraclass correlation coefficients . At a tooth surface level agreement between methods will be estimated using multilevel models to account for the clustering of dental data.\nResults: Automated caries scoring of 3D models was completed as of October 2023, with publication of results expected by July 2024. On-screen assessment has commenced, with expected completion of scoring and data analysis by March 2024. Results will be disseminated by the end of 2024.\nConclusion: The study outcomes may inform new practices that utilize digital models to facilitate dental assessments. Novel approaches that enable remote dental examination without compromising the accuracy of visual examination have wide application in the research environment, clinical practice and for the provision of teledentistry."

    "text": "Objective: To determine the diagnostic agreement between visual examination using the International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS) and on-screen assessment of 3D models with and without fluorescence for caries detection in primary teeth.\nMethods: Children participating in a clinical trial (N=216, average age 5.6 years) underwent visual examination using ICDAS and intraoral scanning using the TRIOS 4 scanner (3Shape TRIOS A/S Denmark). Blinded to the clinical data, four trained and calibrated raters independently performed on-screen assessments for each child’s 3D models using a modified ICDAS. The 3D models were first examined with color, and caries presence and severity were recorded for each tooth surface. This was immediately followed by re-examination with the addition of fluorescence texture. All raters repeated the on-screen assessment process after 4 weeks. Time taken for intraoral scanning and on-screen assessment was recorded. Multilevel logistic regression was used to estimate the tooth surface level agreement between visual examination and on-screen assessment while accounting for the variability amongst the examiners and clustering of the dental caries data. Scatterplots were used to visualize the person level method agreement, and the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) was used to calculate method agreement and examiner reliability. All analyses were undertaken at the initial (ICDAS&gt;1), moderate (ICDAS&gt;3), and extensive disease (ICDAS&gt;5) thresholds.\nConclusion: The findings indicate on-screen assessment of 3D models generated using intraoral scanners is a feasible substitute for visual examination using ICDAS for dental caries data collection epidemiological research involving children."

    "text": "Electronic health record (EHR) data are increasingly used for biomedical research, but these data have recognized data quality challenges. Data validation is necessary to use EHR data with confidence, but limited resources typically make complete data validation impossible. Using EHR data, we illustrate prospective, multiwave, two-phase validation sampling to estimate the association between maternal weight gain during pregnancy and the risks of her child developing obesity or asthma. The optimal validation sampling design depends on the unknown efficient influence functions of regression coefficients of interest. In the first wave of our multiwave validation design, we estimate the influence function using the unvalidated (phase 1) data to determine our validation sample; then in subsequent waves, we re-estimate the influence function using validated (phase 2) data and update our sampling. For efficiency, estimation combines obesity and asthma sampling frames while calibrating sampling weights using generalized raking. We validated 996 of 10,335 mother-child EHR dyads in six sampling waves. Estimated associations between childhood obesity/asthma and maternal weight gain, as well as other covariates, are compared to naïve estimates that only use unvalidated data. In some cases, estimates markedly differ, underscoring the importance of efficient validation sampling to obtain accurate estimates incorporating validated data."
