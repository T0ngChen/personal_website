<b>Objective</b>: This study aimed to demonstrate the use of deep learning for automating caries detection using intraoral scan data from children and to evaluate diagnostic agreement between the modelsâ€™ predictions and dental practitioner assessments on 3D models.

<b>Conclusion</b>: The proof-of-concept demonstrates that deep learning can achieve moderate performance moderate performance in detecting extensive caries from intraoral scans, though performance was limited for early and moderate lesions. Further research is needed to improve model accuracy and generalisability across all disease stages.
